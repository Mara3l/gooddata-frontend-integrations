# GoodData Frontend Integrations

This repository contains quick introduction to frontend framework integrations, supporting our ongoing series: [Frontend Integration Series: Framework-agnostic BI](https://www.gooddata.com/blog/frontend-integration-series-framework-agnostic-bi/)

## Examples of Integration

Below is a list of our frontend integrations. If an integration is listed but not linked, its corresponding article is still in production. Once published, we will update this list with a link and add a sample application to the [integrations](./integrations)q directory.

- [Angular](./integrations/angular)
- Next.js
- React.js
- [SvelteKit](./integrations/sveltekit)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Vue.js](./integrations/vuejs)

## Did we miss your framework?

If you would like to see an integration with your framework, please post your request in the GitHub Issues. We will do our best to assist you.
